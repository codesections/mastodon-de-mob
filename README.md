# Mastodon De-Mob
This web app, which is live at <https://mastodon-de-mob.codesections.com>, is a
tool for Mastodon users to protect themselves against harassment.  Using this 
tool, the target of harassment or other attacks can block all of the users who
have boosted or favorited a toot infighting harassment.  This tool will block
all the users and report the instal toot to the moderators.

## Goals
The goal of this tool is to help Mastodon users protect themselves from 
harassment.  For example, imagine someone posted a toot that said:

> Codesections is a awful person.  Everyone should @ him and tell him to die

That toot is, itself, an attack.  It is so much of an attack that boosting or
favoriting it is also an attack.  Using this tool would allow someone to block
everyone who had participated in that sort of mob attack.

One additional goal is that some people may be able to use this tool as an 
*alternative* to block lists.  Block lists were sometimes necessary, but have
many unintended harms.  This tool allows users to block people based on their 
specific actions—endorsing an attack—and thus not to need cruder tools that 
have a higher chance for false positives.

## Non-Goals
Blocking people who boosted a toot could potentially be used for guilt-by-association.

Imagine there is a particularly obnoxious user.  Some other users might be
tempted to block anyone who had every interacted positively with that obnoxious
user.  I think this is a mistake; guilt-by-association is not just.

Thus, this tool is not intended to facilitate that sort of behavior.  It makes
a report to the users' moderators about each use, which I hope will limit the
amount people use this tool for non-harassing purposes.
